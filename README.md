## Motivation

Originally for my girlfriend who have difficulties to use the terminal :)

This software is build using nwjs.

## Installation

### From the source

Packed the source in a zip (exclude ```/bin```). Rename your ```.zip``` in ```.nw```.

```
nw ~/path/to/yourzip.nw/
```

### From the binary
Download directly the .nw.
```
nw ~/path/to/yourzip.nw/
```
